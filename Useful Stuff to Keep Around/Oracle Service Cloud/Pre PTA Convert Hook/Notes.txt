Useful for logging a contact into CP via PTA using any arbitrary custom field

Here's what you need to authenticate:

Array
(
    [data] => Array
    (
        [decodedData] => Array
        (
            [p_userid] => mikewaldron@helixmail.com
            [p_first_name] => Mike
            [p_last_name] => Waldron
            [p_passwd] => password12345
            [p_li_passwd] => mediacomcc_jan_13
        )
    )
)

But here's what you get coming in:

Array
(
    [data] => Array
    (
        [decodedData] => Array
        (
            [p_li_passwd] => mediacomcc_jan_13
            [p_ccf_1] => AB39E-12
        )
    )
)

You gotta do a lookup using the custom field value and use that info to populate the other fields.
